# Marketing Campaign Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project focused on marketing campaign performance. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering of campaigns based on performance, predictive modeling for ROI, and a Power BI dashboard for visual insights.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Conducted an in-depth analysis of the marketing campaign dataset to uncover patterns and insights.  
   - Visualizations and summary statistics are included in `EDA.ipynb`.  

2. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - **Clustering:** Applied clustering techniques to segment campaigns based on performance metrics such as customer engagement and revenue. Detailed in `Clustering.ipynb`.  
   - **Regression Analysis:** Developed a regression model to predict Return on Investment (ROI) based on campaign factors, detailed in `Regression.ipynb`.  

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**  
   - Designed a Power BI visualization dashboard to present key insights from the data and machine learning models in `PowerBIAnalysis.pbix`.
